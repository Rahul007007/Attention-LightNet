## 📌 Overview

**Attention-LightNet** is a lightweight, real-time deep learning model for detecting powder bed defects during Laser Sintering (LS) in Additive Manufacturing. The model integrates a compact VGG-style architecture with a soft attention mechanism to detect anomalies such as cracks, powder ditches, and voids efficiently and accurately.
